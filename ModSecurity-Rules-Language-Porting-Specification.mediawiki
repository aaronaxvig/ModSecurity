= ModSecurity Rules Language Porting Specification =
This document's aim is to list the minimum ModSecurity Rules Language items which must be implemented by porting projects.  These items are considered '''Level 1: Core Features'''.  It may not be possible to properly implement all ModSecurity capabilities (Lua API, Persistent Storage, etc...) in porting efforts.  These are considered '''Level 2: Advanced Features'''.
