###ModSecurity Ruby support###		
**Brief explanation:** Adding the capability of rapid prototyping to ModSecurity functionalities trough scripts will open the possibility for easy rules production and customization, It also opens the possibility for a large community such as Ruby developers to create their own customization on the top of ModSecurity and so customize their own rules, analogous of today's Lua support.			
**Expected results:** An implementation able to handle Ruby scripts which will interact to ModSecurity as Lua does.
